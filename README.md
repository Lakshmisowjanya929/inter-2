🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project demonstrates handwritten digit recognition using the popular **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm with the **Digits dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`. The model is trained to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9).
